# push_swap
Simple but sufficient "insert sort" style push_swap for 42 school.

The algo work's like that:

1) Converte the input into a "stack". stack is implemented as a very simple double linked list.
2) The slice part:
  The goal there is to identifie the biggest "already sorted sequence in the stack" considering that we can push bad elements into stack B.
3) The insert part:
  taking the elements pushed to stack B one by one we pushe them back to stack A in there expected final place as effectivly that we can
  
 I may try to add more detail about how the algorithm work in the future, but that was the general idea, in the mean time, just ask me.
